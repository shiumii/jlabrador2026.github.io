          <p>(米津 玄師 Yonezu Kenshi, born March 10, 1991), also known by his producer name Hachi (ハチ), is a Tokushima-born artist, musician, singer-songwriter, and VOCALOID song producer and illustrator.

          He started producing VOCALOID original songs around May 2009. Before this, he had already been producing music. The songs which he composes have a unique point of view, which is common in his songs. Similar to his musical works, his illustration style is also very characteristic, using a scribbled style, often combining abstract, surrealist, and urban elements.
